## Context
I built FlavorTrack to mimic an iOS take-home project, completing all stages including brainstorming, planning, developing, and optimizing within 3-4 days as per an employer's expectations.

## App Idea
FlavorTrack is an iOS mobile app that helps users browse nearby F&B outlets, provides detailed information and mark their favorites. FlavorTrack makes it easy to discover new and delicious places to eat, and keeps track of your favorite spots for your next meal.

FlavorTrack uses data provided from Yelp.
